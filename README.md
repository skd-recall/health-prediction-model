‚ù§Ô∏è Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction
‚ú® Objective
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether an individual is at risk of heart disease based on their health data. This task covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and interpretation of feature importance.

üìÅ Dataset
Dataset: Heart dataset

Source: Kaggle

Description: This dataset contains patient health records with features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and other medical indicators. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

‚úÖ Steps Completed
Data Cleaning

Loaded the dataset using pandas.

Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).

Ensured data types were correct and encoded categorical variables if needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated summary statistics using .describe().

Visualized feature distributions with histograms.

Plotted correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between features.

Created box plots to detect outliers.

Explored feature relationships with scatter plots.

Model Building

Selected a classification model: Logistic Regression or Decision Tree.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Trained the model on the training data.

Made predictions on the test set.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated the model using:

Accuracy Score

ROC Curve and AUC

Confusion Matrix

Interpreted metrics to understand model performance.

Feature Importance

Identified and visualized the most significant features contributing to heart disease prediction.

Highlighted insights on how these features impact risk.

Tools Used

pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and cleaning.

matplotlib & seaborn: For EDA visualizations.

scikit-learn: For model training, evaluation, and feature importance.
